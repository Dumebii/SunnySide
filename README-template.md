### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process
I started with a desktop view layout, before going on to optimize for mobile.
My biggest challenges came with setting up background images, and general responsiveness.
I wrote all my HTML out first, and added a few styles before going on a live server to view my work. I was then able to add different tweaks where necessary.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap5
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt a lot on the use of background images. Prior to this project, I didn't even know they were a thing. I also really took out time to learn about responsiveness and media queries.

```html
<a class="navbar-brand" href=""><img src="images\logo.svg" alt="logo">
</a>
```

```css
#title {
    background-color: #42C2FF;
    text-align: center;
    background-image: url('../images/mobile/image-header.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    padding-bottom: 600px;
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```


### Continued development

Definetely going to take out the time to learn more on responsiveness with and without breakpoints. I would also further study on background images.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.weschools.com) - This helped me for all the challenges I had with CSS reason.
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrap.com) - This is the bootstrap official documentation, and it always helps me when I am in doubt of what class names to use.
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co) - This helped me for all the challenges I had with background images and general responsiveness. I'd really recommend him..
